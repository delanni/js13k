js13k - INCREDIBIRD
===================

This is the repository for my js13k entry. Le cliq here to try it out: http://delanni.github.io/js13k/

You can check and try the game at : http://www.js13kgames.com/entries/incredibird

Instructions
------------
You can start the game from the repo's root, with the index.html.
You find the finally submitted form of the code (chopped down, revamped, +soundeffects, minified) @ the minified folder.
Controls for the game are written on the start page of the game. I've forgotten about including some basic instructions, I was stupid, but it's kind of trivial. If it is not, there here they are:

**Use touch buttons on the left, or W,S to move up and down. Shoot with the buttons on the right, or the keys H,J,K,L. The elementals can be killed by shooting the same kind on them. Collect the coins to earn points.**

There you go, I told you it was trivial.

Notice
------
I did not have the time to introduce the sound effects to the un-packaged code, so it is only available in the entry version.
Also I had little time to make the game, so I could not really care for clean and commented code. Most of the logic can be made out from the variable and function names. I will work on the commenting.

Notice also
-----------
I've always wanted to grow long hair, but my hairdresser always cuts it too short.
